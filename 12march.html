                    There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either
                     a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something 
                     challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and
                      forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure
                       varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “
                       The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, 
                    the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”

                    Adventure trips are all about making memories,
                     gaining more knowledge, learning new things
                      about the surroundings and about one’s own self
                       and making lots of great stories. Going for an 
                       adventure camp is the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get 
                    out of their ordinary lives and try new things
